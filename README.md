# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## üìä Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `Retail`
**DBMS**: MySQL

This project demonstrates SQL skills and techniques used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The goal is to set up a retail sales database, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answer business-driven questions using SQL queries. It's an excellent resource for beginners looking to build a solid foundation in data analysis and SQL.

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `Retail`.

- **Table Creation**: A table named `Retail_Sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.


```sql

CREATE DATABASE Retail;

USE Retail;

CREATE TABLE Retail_Sales(
	transaction_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	sale_date DATE, 
	sale_time TIME, 
	customer_ID INT, 
	gender VARCHAR(10), 
	age INT DEFAULT 0, 
	category VARCHAR(20),
	quantity INT ,
	price_per_unit FLOAT,
	cogs FLOAT,
	total_sale FLOAT

);

```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Count the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories.
- **Null Value Check**: Identify and remove records with missing data.

```sql
-- Count total records
SELECT count(*) FROM Retail_Sales;  


-- --------------- --- Data Cleaning - Remove NULL values

SELECT * FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE transaction_ID = NULL OR
	sale_date = NULL OR
	sale_time= NULL OR
	customer_ID = NULL OR
	gender = NULL OR
	age = NULL OR
	category = NULL OR
	quantity = NULL OR
	cogs = NULL OR
	price_per_unit = NULL OR
	total_sale = NULL ;

/*
IN MYSQL
 Safe update mode is enabled, 
 preventing DELETE or UPDATE without a WHERE condition that includes a key column (like PRIMARY KEY).
 
*/
-- Temporarily Disable Safe Mode 

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR
    sale_time IS NULL OR
    customer_ID IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR
    age IS NULL OR
    category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR
    cogs IS NULL OR
    price_per_unit IS NULL OR
    total_sale IS NULL;

-- Safe update mode is enabled again

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
 
 
-- ------------------------ Data Exploration

-- Read Data 
SELECT * FROM Retail_Sales; 

-- How many sales we have ?
SELECT count(*) FROM Retail_Sales;  

-- How many uniuque customers we have ?
SELECT count(DISTINCT customer_ID) FROM Retail_Sales;

-- How many uniuque category we have?
SELECT count(DISTINCT category) FROM Retail_Sales;


```
